    <p><strong>What Is Fly Ash?</strong></p>
    <p>Fly ash is a fine residue produced from the combustion of pulverized coal, widely used as a supplementary material in concrete. 
        Its inclusion enhances the durability and workability of concrete, making it a preferred choice in construction.
         By replacing a portion of cement, fly ash reduces the heat of hydration, lowering the risk of cracking in large structures. 
         Additionally, it minimizes concrete's permeability, offering greater resistance to chemical attacks and environmental impacts. 
         Fly ash contributes to sustainability by recycling industrial waste and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with cement production, aligning with eco-friendly construction practices.</p><br><br>
